		<h1>Website Evaluation - <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> - Summary</h1>
    	<p>Reddit is a social news aggregation site. News articles are submitted by users into a stream of submissions. Each submission has a karma value. Every user can either add one point of karma to an article or remove one point. Articles with the most points for a given amount of time end up on the home page. Each article also has a discussion page. Here, users can comment on articles. Each comment has a similar karma system, with top scoring comments appearing above lower scoring comments.</p>
        <p>Articles can be submitted to subreddits; sub categories for articles of a specific interest. </p>
        <p>The overall karma scores of comments and submissions by each user is kept in their profile. Having more karma does not make your vote more powerful. </p>
        <p>The site has a bland look with a large focus on text. There is a very limited use of icons. Icons that are used are very small, simple, and require little explanation.</p>
        <p>There is a simple search feature that appears on the top right of every page on the website.</p>
