<p>I made the video by first zooming into Douglass campus from a view of the earth. Next, I went from gigapan to gigapan by first zooming out, then double clicking a gigapan. This seemed to be smoother than unpredictable flight paths (which often looked at the sky) and was easier to do (didn't crash my computer). I added transitions between the flight clips and the gigapan clips to smooth things out. Finally, I added a couple titles to describe where it was we were zooming to in the fisrt two clips.</p>
